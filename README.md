The idea behind all of these scripts is to create hierarchical terrons allowing for terrons at multiple scales depending on the study area.
The scripts use continuous raster data so terron can be modeled by:  
  terron = f(soil, climate, landscape, soil \* climate \* landscape)
  
The instructions file helps for understanding the 5 scripts that are associated with defining terrons. 
There is a flowchart of how the script works in the scripts folder.

The publication pre-print is available as well. Contact me if you have any questions regarding the code or if there are issues that arise while executing the code.
